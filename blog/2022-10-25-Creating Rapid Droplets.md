### Creating droplets with questdb

Assuming you have basic knowledge of how to use a computer and the internet, this guide will show you how to create a droplet of questdb step-by-step.

- First, you will need to create an account with Digital Ocean. You can do this by going to their website and clicking on the "Sign Up" button. Once you have created your account and logged in, you will be taken to the main dashboard.

- Second, you will need to click on the "Create" button in the top left-hand corner. This will take you to the "Create Droplet" page.

- Third, you will need to select the size of the droplet you want to create. Questdb is a lightweight database, so you can probably get away with the $5/mo option.

- Fourth, you will need to select a datacenter region. It doesn't really matter which one you choose, but it might be best to choose one that is closest to you.

- Fifth, you will need to select a deployment method. The easiest way to deploy questdb is to use the "One-Click Apps" option.

- Sixth, you will need to select the questdb app from the list of available apps.

- Seventh, you will need to give your droplet a name. This can be anything you want.

- Eighth, you will need to select a payment method. You can either pay with a credit card or with PayPal.

- Ninth, you will need to review your choices and then click on the "Create Droplet" button.

Once your droplet has been created, you will be taken to the main dashboard. From here, you can click on the "Droplets" menu item in the left-hand sidebar to view a list of all your droplets.

You can click on the name of your droplet to view more information about it. You will also be able to see the IP address of your droplet here.

To access your questdb database, you will need to use a database management tool like phpMyAdmin. You can find the link to phpMyAdmin in the "Databases" section of the control panel.

Once you have phpMyAdmin open, you will need to login with the username and password that you set when you created the droplet.

Once you are logged in, you will be taken to the main phpMyAdmin dashboard. From here, you can click on the "Databases" tab to view a list of all the databases on your droplet.

To access your questdb database, you will need to click on the "questdb" database in the list. This will take you to the questdb database management page.

From here, you can add, edit, or delete questdb database tables and data. You can also use the phpMyAdmin interface to run SQL queries on your questdb database.
